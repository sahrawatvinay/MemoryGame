* How I built the Memory Game-
- I manipulated the DOM with Vanilla JS, modified HTML and also styled them.
- When the game is refreshed the pack of cards is reshuffled.
- Created a counter and timer to record the no. of moves and time taken by the user.
- Rating is being given to the user based on the performance.
